J: Let's go through your requirements for the house, starting with your hobbies, maybe? E: I am into gardening, and I have always wanted a greenhouse. J: What style of greenhouse do you prefer? E: Not the aluminum ugly ones. I would like to have something traditional , in wood or iron, like the old English greenhouses. J: Should it be heated? E: I don’t know, it would be great to use it as a patio as well during winter, maybe, to drink tea? But again, I do not want to run up our power bill. B: That is another thing we would like to discuss, the house should be zero emission, based on reusable power. J: What type of power are you thinking about? I see three options: solar, wind, and a small hydroelectric plant on the brook running through the property. E: Solar or hydro sounds good, but I do not like the idea of a wind turbine due to the noise . B: But would solar produce enough power? J: There are solar applications available on the web that, given the location and the number of panels, will forecast the energy you can expect. B: Let's find out. How many panels will fit on the roof? J: We will get those numbers once the initial drawing is done. E: Note that solar panels will provide extra power in addition to the grid; you cannot run appliances when the electricity grid fails. Is the idea to be self-reliant, or to be zero-emission? B: What would that require? E: A series of batteries to store the solar energy and a transformer to bring 12 volts up to 220 for household use. These are not cheap , though. E: What about winter time and snow on the roof? J: A combination of wind and solar could also be an option. The turbine can be placed separately away from the house. Note that you will need permission from the local municipality, though. B: What height would it be? Is there a maximum? It might cause complaints from the neighbors, ruining their view. E: The blades could kill birds, too?  J: Note that wind turbines are more expensive compared to solar panels and require maintenance . B: It might be worth looking into, depending on the power output? J: I will check the maximum height and some models. Based on a wind map, we can get a rough number. B: I think the hydro plant is not an option as the brook is rain-dependent and dries up in Summer.
